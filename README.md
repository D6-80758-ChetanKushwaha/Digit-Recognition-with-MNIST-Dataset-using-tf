# MNIST Digit Recognition with CNN Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) preprocessing pipeline for MNIST digit recognition. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 labeled handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 digits for testing. It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.0 >
- TensorFlow 2.12.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/chintu512/Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-Dataset-using-tf.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-Dataset-using-tf
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the `mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb` script using jupyter notebook or colab:

2. The script will load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, define and train a CNN model, evaluate the model's performance, and visualize some predictions.

## Results

The script will output the following results:

- Test Loss: [test_loss]
- Test Accuracy: [test_accuracy]
- Classification Report:
[classification_report]
- Confusion Matrix:
[confusion_matrix]

It will also display a visualization of randomly selected test images with their true labels and predicted labels.
